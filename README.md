# bamazon

bamazon is designed to log product purchases from the mySQL file.

The user is then asked to select a product ID from the listed products.

The user is then asked to choose how many of that item.

Depending on the stock remaining of that item, it will show the user a message. Telling them that
the cart has been updated or that there was not enough stock left for their purchase.

mySQL will update if an item was added to the cart.
